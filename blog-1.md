By employing its rich type system, TypeScript contributes to JavaScript development in that it allows developers to declare data types, thus producing a safer and more predictable code. In addition to its rich type system, it also offers other features such as union types and intersection types, two concepts that can truly increase creativity and control over type definitions in one’s apps. Such types are important because any TypeScript developer has to deal with many other types of data more easily. So let us first look at the importance of union and intersection types and then explore examples for each.


1. Union Types:

Union types can be very beneficial since a variable is allowed to take on one of the many types. This is particularly effective when a range of types is needed but not an indiscriminate combination of types. This allows for the variation of data potential inputs and still encourages fending off the exposure of the system to risks of type errors.

How Union Types Function:
Union types are defined with the use of | (a pipe sign) connecting the types. For example, if a function argument can be a string and a number, it can be defined as string | number.

Applications of Union Types:
For example, interface got a set of methods (for example, User Input, which can be implemented as text and number) which can accept values of different types.
Creating methods which are expected/can yield different result types based on various conditions.
Making sure that any - such as an API interface data source that will - return data that fits more than one type, is effectively managed.

Example 1: Function Definition and Union Types

Let’s think about the function which is supposed to calculate the length of some value. It must take as a parameter a string in order to count how many characters are there or an array, in order to count the number of items in that array.

function getLength(value: string | any[]): number {
    return value.length;
}

console.log(getLength("Hello")); // Expected output: 5
console.log(getLength([1,2,3,4])); // Expected output: 4

Here, getLength function will take as a parameter any string or array and we can safely access .length property since both string and array types have it. Typescript does not allow calling getLength with any type.value will be a string or an array and therefore no need to make further assertions to check whether this is true.


2. Intersection Types:

The intersection type makes it possible to conflate several types in one. Therefore, when we declare a variable of this type, we assume that all the types within the intersection hold true. Thus, this is especially useful in cases where one has to enhance some features or elements of different types.

Understanding Intersection Types:
Intersection types are formed by using the ampersand (&) symbol in between two or more types. The type so derived has all the features of the types combined to create this new type.

Occupation of Intersection Types:
Combining several interfaces for the purpose of forming a new type that fulfills all requirements.
Realization of a type that embraces more than one position, for instance, a person who is a user in the system and also has the right to administer the system.
Mandating that the objects contain all attributes from the several interfaces.


Example 1: The Use of Intersection Types in Composition

Let us assume that we want to form an object called User and include appropriate Admin properties. Healthy instead of forming one big interface with repeating properties, we can instead facilitate the use of intersection types.

interface User {
    name: string;
    email: string;
}

interface Admin {
    adminLevel: number;
    permissions: string[];
}

type AdminUser = User & Admin;

const adminUser: AdminUser = {
    name: "Alice",
    email: "alice@example.com",
    adminLevel: 1,
    permissions: ["read", "write", "delete"]
};

console.log(adminUser);

Here, AdminUser contains all the fields of User and Admin roles. The type that is created requires the existence of attributes of both roles so that the adminUser can perform the functions of both.



Crucial Distinction between Union Type and Intersection Type:

A Union Type (|) is a type that permits a value to be included in one several other types, but not in all at the same time. They are beneficial since they enable variables to accept numerous types which is especially important when dealing with parameters or return types that are expected to differ.
An Intersection Type (&) is a type that encompasses all of its constituent types at once. This is appropriate in case of designing complex types since it compels an object or value to have properties from more than one type.


Conclusion: Picking between Union Type and Intersection Types:

Types union and intersection are two types which allow better and more secure and effective coding structures in TypeScript. They are types of inclusion: when the value belongs to one or several groups, for instance Age can be an int, float, string, and several others.

Using such types allows you to reduce the type constraints while improving the overall clarity of the TypeScript code.
